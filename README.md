Hello! My name is Amanda Tum. I am a bachelor student studying computer science.

I am passionate about creating solutions to computer and business problems. In my free time, I also devote myself to designing and creating small models.

I have experience with C++, C, SQL, PHP, HTML and CSS, and Java.

In the past, I have collaborated with other creators in character design, app design, web design and 
development, and software development.
